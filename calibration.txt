# The pressure conversion can be set here, using an expression such as:
#
#   p = (2 * v) + 5
#
# Where v is the voltage reading from the device
# If no value is specified, or if there is a problem reading the specified
# conversion, then the default value is used:
#
#   p = (5.0221 * v) - 24.036
#
# Set the pressure conversion calculation:
p = (5.0221 * v) - 24.036
